# MODELS OF OPTIMIZATION FOR THE PLANIFICATION OF CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSIONS IN AN ONCOHEMATOLOGICAL DAY-HOSPITAL

This is the work done for my Bachelor Discussion. 

It's an Operational Research study that aims to optimize the organization of the San Martino Hospital of Genoa. 
The secondary goal is to understand if rearenging all the oncology departiments under one structure would give a major positive impact.

The models were tested on the real data provided by the San Martino Hospital of Genoa reported to the year 2018.
